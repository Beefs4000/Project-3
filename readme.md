    For this project I decided to make a social media posting site. It has has a backend and a front end. It grants users the ability to add, remove, like, and update various posts. I used MongoDB, Express, Node, React, GraphQL, and Node. With this implementation I used a GraphQL server that uses Node and Express to communicate to a MongoDB Database and fetch and persist data to a social media app back-end. This was a very difficult project and it required hours and hours of tutorials for me to complete. Aside from the general difficulty of creating the app, maintaining syntax and naming conventions across the all the files was a painful and caused a lot of debugging
